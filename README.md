# Aseprite-Compiler

## What is this?
Aseprite-Compiler is a simple tool that does what you think:

Compile Aseprite on the user's computer.

## Why?
Aseprite is a great pixel art editor, but the compiled binarys are not free.

Even if the binarys are not free, you can build your own version of Aseprite as it is open source.

It is a big pain to build Aseprite from scratch.

So, I created this tool to help you build Aseprite.

Just choose the version of Aseprite you want to build and the compiler`†` will do the rest.

`†`compiler: It is not actually a compiler, but a tool that will help you build Aseprite.
